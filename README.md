Tracker Keeper is a goal management tool written in AngularJS. It's a single page application that I'm currently hosting on my portfolio site at http://jefdewitt.com/trackerkeeper/.

I created TrackerKeeper as a means to chart my progress toward specific goals, goals measured in time. Tracker Keeper makes it easy to track the time you spend toward achieving these goals, and uses simple algebra to document the headway your making to keep you motivated.
